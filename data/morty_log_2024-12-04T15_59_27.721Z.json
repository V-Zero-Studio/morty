the following based on the attached template. do not make it longer.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Mentoring Plan}\n\n\n\n\nThe PI's mentoring approach emphasizes the holistic development of graduate students as both researchers and professionals, aiming to cultivate not only their technical skills in HCI but also their abilities to generate broader impact based on their research. This plan will help students navigate their academic journey and prepare them for diverse career paths in academia, industry, or beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Career Counseling}\n\nThe PI will provide tailored career counseling through quarterly one-on-one meetings (in addition to regular weekly meetings), encouraging students to reflect on their career plan and discuss recent opportunities and notable success examples. The PI will actively help students set short- and long-term career goals, connect them with relevant professionals in their field, and guide them through processes such as networking, internship applications, job talk, and interviews. The PI will also support students in attending workshops related to their research interest and top conferences where they can build connections and disseminate their work.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Training in Preparation of Proposals, Publications, and Presentations}\n\nStudents will receive training in writing research articles, conference presentations, and grant proposals. \n\nThe PI will provide detailed feedback on manuscript drafts and encourage students to publish their work in high-impact conferences and journals. The PI will also help students develop effective communication skills by encouraging them to present their research at group meetings, workshops, and conferences and providing guidance on creating clear and engaging slides, posters, and narratives.\n\nFurther, the PI will mentor students, perhaps at a more senior stage of their PhD program, in the complete process of preparing competitive research proposals by reviewing drafts, discussing funding opportunities, and offering insight into structuring a compelling proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Improvement of Teaching and Mentoring Skills}\n\nThe PI will provide opportunities for graduate students to improve their teaching and mentoring abilities. For those interested in teaching, the PI will encourage participation in teaching assistantships and provide constructive feedback on their performance. The PI will also share best practices in pedagogy, including active learning strategies and student engagement techniques. In terms of mentoring, The PI will provide opportunities for senior graduate students to mentor undergraduates or newer graduate students in the lab, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. The PI will provide resources and advice on how to be an effective mentor and how to foster positive mentor-mentee relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Collaboration with Researchers from Diverse Backgrounds and Disciplines}\n\nThe PI will encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of diverse methods in research. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with researchers from various fields, both within the institution and through external partnerships. The PI will guide students on how to communicate effectively across disciplinary boundaries and how to leverage collaborators' expertise to strengthen a project. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Training in Responsible Professional Practices}\n\nEthical and responsible professional conduct is a cornerstone of this mentoring plan. The PI will provide training on responsible research practices, including research integrity, data management, and ethical considerations related to human subjects. The PI will also emphasize the importance of inclusivity and equity, ensuring that students are aware of their responsibilities as professionals. Discussions on issues such as authorship, conflicts of interest, and peer review will be integrated into regular one-on-one meetings.\n\n\n\n\nBy supporting students in these above areas, the PI aims to prepare them to be well-rounded professionals who are capable of excelling in diverse roles and contributing positively to the HCI

framework for designing an AI-infused information processing system at early design stages, primarily by formulating AI’s roles in sensemaking and decision-making processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewer 2 (R2) noted the challenges in formulating a coherent framework for AI-infused workflows, given the fragmented knowledge within and beyond the field. Reviewers appreciate the authors’ efforts, finding the idea interesting (R1), the problem timely and significant (R3), and the evaluation comprehensive (R3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, reviewers also identified several key weaknesses in the current manuscript:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Unclear or overly broad scope (R1, R2, R3): R1 mentions it is unclear which types of AI applications are intended to be included in the framework. Similarly, R3 notes that without specific domain connections, the framework may face applicability issues. R2 also suggests that focusing on sensemaking may be too narrow, and R3 finds the definition of information “broad and lacking concrete depth.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Insufficient engagement with the literature (R1, R2, R3): All reviewers recommend additional literature for consideration. R1 mentions that the scale from reactive to proactive is very relevant to Klien, et al 2004 paper, which offers a deeper discussion. R3 recommends incorporating more knowledge from other fields.\n\nAlso, R3 found some claims in the manuscript lack support from cited works, especially considering the unique contexts and constraints of these papers and domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Participant sampling is not representative (R1, R3): R1 suggests that “students are not a good proxy for professionals,” while R3 recommends including participants beyond the HCI field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Findings lack depth (R1, R2): R1 finds the study results are not sufficiently connected with design practitioners, and R2 considers the findings “superficial and polite.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are further insightful comments in each review, such as R1’s notes on the complexity of interaction design, the importance of responsible AI (R1), and the actionability of the guidance (R3). I encourage the authors to carefully review these comments and strengthen the paper accordingly. I look forward to seeing a refined version of this promising work in future venues.\n\nReviewer 1 (2AC)\n\nExpertise\n\nExpert\n\nOriginality (Round 1)\n\nMedium originality\n\nSignificance (Round 1)\n\nLow significance\n\nResearch Quality (Round 1)\n\nLow research quality\n\nContribution Compared to Length (Round 1)\n\nThe paper was too long in addressing its claimed contribution.\n\nFigure Descriptions\n\n(blank)\n\nRecommendation (Round 1)\n\nI can go with either Reject or Revise and Resubmit\n\nReview (Round 1)\n\nThe authors developed a framework to guide professional designers during the ideation phase of an AI innovation project. The framework presents AI as an information processing assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis paper offers an interesting idea, the reframing that casts AI as an information processing assistant working for the user. I encourage the authors to continue this line of work. The paper has several problems that make it not ready for publication. At this time, I cannot easily tell if these might be addressed with minor edits or if it would require more substantive work, such as running a new study with professional designers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the paper was understanding the scope this framework is meant to address. If this could be resolved, other problems might go away. I’m struggling to make sense of the framework and to understand AI systems that would or would not fit. It seems like spam filters are scoped out. The authors would view this as automation, not decision-making. Is the same true for driverless car features like the Tesla, where the user is supposed to monitor the behavior of the AI and take over if there is an error? Many AI systems seem to be used to relieve stress, which does not really fit well with sensemaking and decision-making. People will use services like Google Maps to check how bad the traffic is for their commute home, or they will check the weather for tomorrow. Here, knowledge is often more comforting because it removes uncertainty, even when the news is not what people want. Does the framework lend itself to interacting with Alexa? If I say, “Alexa, play Spotify...” is this really sensemaking and decision-making? It’s clearly command and control, but that is not a part of the current framework as far as I can tell. The authors use the example of AI in clinical decision-making. Does this include systems that trigger alerts? ICU nurses get 100-400 alerts each day, leading to alert fatigue. Is this considered by the framework or is it out of scope? I would encourage the authors to scope what types of applications lend themselves to their framework. Give the reader a clearer sense of the kinds of interfaces and interactions it was made to support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nThe paper is missing a clear motivation for building this framework. The authors state, “... there remains a lack of support for the early stage where designers ideate and explore interaction designs of an AI-infused system. Supporting ideation and exploration is important, especially for novices, such as students studying HCI who do not yet possess a repertoire of design experiences at their disposal.” This statement leaps out of nowhere. I do agree there is a need to support ideation, but the authors don’t cite any of the HCI research that demonstrates this, nor do they address the challenges that the research brings up: designers don’t understand AI capabilities, designers think of things that cannot be built, data scientists struggle to effectively collaborate with other roles within the enterprise ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe motivation also has a scope challenge. When the authors say early stage, do they mean before an AI application has been selected? Or, are they talking about the ideation of interface options? Are they assuming that HCI joins an AI innovation project only after the application has been selected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing related work; this might be a scoping issue. If they exclusively focus on the interaction design, and not the selection of the AI application, then this likely does not matter.\n\n- People think of things that cannot be built (Yang: sketching NLP; Yang: Re-examining whether, why, and how; Dove: machine learning as design material; Yildirim: Creating design resources to scaffold the ideation of AI concepts)\n\n- IBM work on challenges of integrating data science in the enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective on Interaction Design/HCI\n\nThe authors seem to hold an overly simplistic view of interaction design. They assume that the designer’s sole purpose is to address users’ needs. But that is most often not the case. For example, people doing web searches want fast and accurate results. Web search companies want people to click on ad links. The web search interface works to find harmony and serve the needs of both the service provider and their user. Service design is the challenge of discovering opportunities to co-create value between users and service providers, creating interfaces that support both in getting what they want. The needs of the service are not in the framework. That could be fine, assuming the authors acknowledge that their framework does not address this aspect of the interaction design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants\n\nStudents are not a good proxy for professionals. If the authors wish to make things for students, they might focus on how this could teach students important aspects of H-AI. Students aa a proxy for professionals is bad. If they switch to a more learning stance, they might try this with a pre- and post- test to measure the learning gains. I do not accept their claim that professionals won’t share due to company concerns. Other HCI research has studied professionals and this includes work done by companies (IBM, Google) as well as work done by academics who made arrangements to study professionals.

The framework addresses some of the very early stages of the process such as asking what kind of sense-making assistance the user of the future system requires. The framework and the workbook were deployed in a graduate project-based class and the evolution of the framework was performed through interviews with the student project teams. The authors also interviewed 3 individuals with relevant industry experience. Underpinning all this work is a synthesis of relevant design knowledge pertaining to the field of human-AI interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis synthesis (presented in Sections 2 and 3) is the intellectual core of the paper. Let me start by acknowledging that attempting such a synthesis is a particularly challenging task because knowledge related to human-AI interaction is incomplete, fragmented and a lot of it is tacit. A successful synthesis would (possibly within some narrow scope) capture and curate a coherent range of concepts that are reasonably comprehensive het succinct and coherent. This is super difficult. I commend the authors for giving it a try but I believe that their current framework is too preliminary for publication. I realize my evaluation will be fairly subjective but perhaps I can start by listing a few prior publications that attempted to create coherent frameworks in this space. While each is narrowly scoped and imperfect in various ways, I think all of them succeed at striking a balance of balance of being reasonably comprehensive within their stated scope and also well-curated.

Woods (1986), however, points out that there is a broader space of cognitive challenges that people experience (including, e.g., premature commitment) each of which requiring a different class of cognitive support. I find the focus on sense-making and the concept of information hierarchy in the submitted manuscript too narrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs another example, when considering the mechanisms for human-AI collaboration, the manuscript appropriately considers the concept of mixed-initiative and asks designers to decide where their product would sit on the scale from reactive to proactive. This is a relevant concept but the Klien, et al 2004 paper also thoughtfully considers how the human and AI would make their goals visible to one another and how they would negotiate and re-negotiate these goals throughout their collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the conceptual foundation is not quite there, in my opinion, I have only skimmed the evaluation with graduate students. The set up of that evaluation looks perfectly sensible — no red flags. I read the interviews with the experts more carefully. I found the finings superficial and “polite”. I haven’t learned much from that section. One reason, I think, is that the framework is still weak so the experts did not have all that much to say. Another reason, I think, is that the industry currently does a fairly poor job of designing AI-powered products so there are very few (if any) real experts in this space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking it all together, given the state of design knowledge in the field of human-AI interaction, I think the task of putting what we know into a useful and coherent framework is exceedingly difficult. I am impressed with how far the authors have gotten but I do not think that what they have is ready for sharing yet.\n\nReviewer 3 (reviewer)\n\nExpertise\n\nKnowledgeable\n\nOriginality (Round 1)\n\nLow originality\n\nSignificance (Round 1)\n\nMedium significance\n\nResearch Quality (Round 1)\n\nMedium research quality\n\nContribution Compared to Length (Round 1)\n\nThe paper length was commensurate with its contribution.\n\nFigure Descriptions\n\nThe figure descriptions are adequate and follow the accessibility guidelines.\n\nRecommendation (Round 1)\n\nI recommend Reject\n\nReview (Round 1)\n\nThe paper introduces a framework to help novice designers structure AI-infused workflows by defining AI’s role in sense-making and decision-making. Tested in a graduate HCI course, the framework guided early ideation, with expert feedback suggesting adaptations for professional use. While the paper addresses a significant problem and provides an important framework and evaluation, its insufficiently justified framework and lack of in-depth discussion prevent me from recommending it for acceptance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength\n\nThe paper addresses a timely and significant problem with the rise of AI-infused systems. With the growing influence of LLMs and generative AI methods, designing AI-infused systems is becoming increasingly important for the future of technology.\n\nThe paper evaluates the proposed framework thoroughly and clearly. The user study includes 25 participants in a class, using a seminar to assess the framework’s usability. The results indicate the framework’s effectiveness, grouping findings into two themes with a logical flow. The insights are supported by a detailed qualitative analysis, providing a solid foundation. Additionally, the authors conducted expert interviews to gain further insights and feedback on the proposed framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe proposed framework lacks novelty and in-depth discussion. Although the paper incorporates research from the CHI and AI communities, including mixed-initiative systems and sense-making/decision-making models, the information remains broad and lacks concrete depth. For instance, categorizing decision-making into “generative” and “predictive” is too general; these categories differ widely. Ensemble and single predictions, for example, represent distinct decision-making processes, and the framework would benefit from considering such nuances and different modalities.\n\nMoreover, the framework lacks actionable insights that stakeholders can directly use. Although the paper presents a variety of methods useful for human-AI collaboration, it does not address how and when to apply these methods. For example, in Sec. 3.2 (Mixed Initiative), the paper lists three “key points”—reactive, mixed-initiative, and proactive. These definitions are accurate and well-accepted; however, there is no discussion on when to use each method, how to determine the timing of the initiative for proactive systems, or the appropriate interaction medium for the initiative. Without detailed guidelines on when and how to apply these three methods, the audience may struggle to effectively implement them.\n\nThe reasoning process behind some claims appears overly confident, with certain claims lacking adequate support. These claims are based on existing research, which may be domain-specific and conditioned by specific scenarios. The paper does not provide sufficient discussion and analysis on these relevant domains and conditions, making some conclusions feel ungrounded. For example, in examining overreliance on AI, the paper cites [10] (reference ID in the paper) as supporting evidence. However, [10] also noted a tradeoff where participants rated designs that minimized overreliance the lowest in terms of favorability. Furthermore, [10] bases its findings on scenarios where the AI’s top prediction was incorrect. Thus, in contexts where AI is highly reliable or the task is time-sensitive, the claim might not apply. Additionally, a more recent paper [A] suggests that explanations can reduce overreliance without employing restrictive measures. Balancing perspectives from papers with differing viewpoints and providing a more comprehensive review would strengthen the argument.\n\nThe framework lacks a connection to actual domains and conditions, which can significantly impact the application of its guidelines. Different domains may impose unique requirements when applying these guidelines. For example, as previously noted in the mixed-initiative section, various domains and tasks may demand distinct considerations in initiative method design. Therefore, it is essential to discuss how to characterize domain-specific requirements for different approaches and to explore how these methods might be implemented across actual domains.\n\nEven though I appreciate the authors' efforts in the evaluation, the evaluation design is still limited by the lack of diversity among participants and experts. The participants share the same major, and the experts are all from HCI communities. However, human-AI collaboration is also relevant in other domains, such as medical and creative fields. Relying solely on HCI community experts may limit the generalizability of the conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions\n\nI suggest that the authors refine the framework by adding more in-depth discussion and reorganizing its structure. Presenting more concrete, actionable insights and distilling the discussion into specific guidelines would enhance its usefulness. Additionally, the paper should avoid making broad claims without scoping the relevant conditions and application areas, as generating universal guidelines may not be feasible. It would also strengthen the paper to include a broader range of papers from different domains and perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n[A] Explanations Can Reduce Overreliance on AI Systems
